So today I set up hosting for this site and am eagerly waiting for my DNS settings to propegate. Pretty soon you'll be able to access this site from the intended domain (www.michaelwlu.com)!

I decided to go with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for my hosting purposes. They were the recommended choice in the Gatsby docs and I dont regret it. Setting up the hosting was as simple as making a Netlify account linked to my Github and following some on screen prompts. They did everything else.

This website has really been fun to develop and I appreciate how much work goes into all the sites that I've used throughout my life. Even the really shitty sites had some guy (or girl) working a long time to get that thing running.

I'm really excited to see where this career takes me and what's next.

Just added a screenshot because every blog post needs an image, right? I really need to clean up some of the styling in here to look more professional.
