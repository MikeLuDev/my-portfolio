# This is my portfolio website

Currently a work in progress, this will eventually be the codebase for my portfolio website and blog.

## Built with

This project was built with the following tools:

* ReactJS
* Gatsby

TODO (in order of importance):

* Fill out music page
* Finish portfolio page
* Fix .scss files not building properly with `gatsby build`
* Add logo
* Make contact form functional (check out nodemailer)
* Add blog content and define styling
* Add transitions with react-transition-group (maybe I can do this on a layout component for full page loads?
* Add "projects" section or similar
* Move all static files (images, etc.) to /public/static/
