So here we are, the beginning of my words on the internet.

I've realized that one of the most important things is the source of our motivations. It is awareness of the why of our doings that can enable either success or failure.

Take for example, this blog. It is something that I want to create and contribute to. Do I think I'll have thousands of readers? No. There is very little chance that in a sea of voices mine might be heard above anyone elses. But the motivation for my doing, the reason that I am writing these words at this moment, that comes intrinsically.

It's the same with anything else. Learning programming, losing weight, doing chores...all of these are things we might want to do, but find difficult to do after a short period of explosive action. This is fundamentally because our motivations come from other people, not ourselves. It is not sustainable to learn something to make more money, lose weight to attract the opposite sex, or do chores because your wife might nag you if you don't. It is sustainable to do them if the reason is within yourself.

I truly believe that it would have been impossible for me to land a job as a developer if it wasn't for the fact that I'm not programming for anyone else but myself. The challenge and thrill of solving problems is what gets me up in the morning. I relish facing a seeming insurmountable wall, because I know there is a way to cross it, I only have to find it.

And so we have the beginnings of a blog. I'll populate it with things not for anyone but myself. That's really the only way to do it well.
